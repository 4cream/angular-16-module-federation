# angular-16-module-federation
Use Angular 16 with the Module Federation plugin

In this repository, I will upload everything related to the necessary configuration to correctly set up module federation with Angular 16. 
I will create multiple branches to configure the shell and remote projects with the ModuleFederationPlugin and with the withModuleFederationPlugin. 
Additionally, I will attempt to share libraries and services from the shell to the remotes.
